# GoLang Tutorials, MongoDB, gRPC, and REST API Projects

Here GoLang Tutorials, MongoDB, gRPC, and REST API Projects repository which I had learned during my intern period! This repository contains a collection of projects and tutorials related to Go programming, MongoDB, gRPC, and building RESTful APIs.

## Projects

### 1. GoLang Tutorials
This directory contains a series of tutorials for learning Go programming. Each tutorial focuses on a specific aspect of the Go language and includes code examples to help you understand the concepts better.

### 2. MongoDB Project
In the `mongodb-project` directory, you'll find a project that demonstrates how to work with MongoDB in Go. It includes code examples for connecting to a MongoDB database, performing CRUD operations, and handling data using the MongoDB driver for Go.

### 3. gRPC Project
The `grpc-project` directory contains a project that showcases how to implement a gRPC server and client in Go. It includes an example of defining protocol buffer messages, creating a gRPC server, and interacting with it using a client.

### 4. REST API Project
Inside the `restapi-project` directory, you'll discover a project that guides you through building a RESTful API using Go. This project covers topics like routing, handling requests and responses, and structuring your API for scalability.

## How to Use
Each project or tutorial directory contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the code. Follow the instructions provided in the respective directories to get started with the projects or learn from the tutorials.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Go programming environment set up.
- MongoDB installed and running for the MongoDB project.
- Basic understanding of gRPC and REST API concepts for the respective projects.
